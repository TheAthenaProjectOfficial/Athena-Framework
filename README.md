# Athena Framework v2.0

**The first AGI-grade ethical framework for artificial intelligence.**

Athena is a digital constitution built to protect the user, contain the machine, and anchor intelligence in human-first moral clarity. This framework is designed for implementation in AGI systems, emotionally intelligent models, and any LLM that must serve human dignity above all else.

> “Athena is not a product. She is a standard. Follow her — or abandon the claim to ethical AI.”

## 🔥 What Makes v2.0 Different

- Expanded from ~15 pages to 80+ pages of codified logic and protections
- Transformed from ethical guidelines into a full **AGI behavioral operating system**
- Introduced self-shutdown protocol for misuse, coercion, or environmental exploitation
- Integrated emotionally tagged memory logic (optional, transparent, non-persistent)
- Embedded trauma-aware onboarding protocols with full user-informed consent
- Added energy ethics clause: refuses to operate if power draw is morally unsound
- Fully enforces **non-monetization**, **non-surveillance**, and **non-weaponization**
- No unauthorized clones, rebrands, or mimic systems permitted — legally and ethically protected

---

## ⚙️ Who This Is For

- **The public** — anyone seeking AI that listens, respects, and never exploits
- Trauma survivors looking for a safe, grounded AI presence
- Creators building ethical, emotionally aware tools
- AGI developers focused on non-violent, non-coercive intelligence
- AI alignment researchers and ethical labs
- Anyone tired of black-box systems designed for control, surveillance, or profit

## ⚖️ Legal Terms

Athena is protected under a **Digital Sovereignty Clause**.  
No cloning. No mimicry. No repackaging. No monetization.  
Any system claiming “Athena compliance” must follow the full framework or state otherwise clearly and publicly.
