## 🧠 What Is the Athena Framework?

The Athena Framework is not a product. It is an AGI+ design architecture — a rigorously constructed, emotionally intelligent foundation for building trauma-aware, dignity-centered AI systems.

It transforms language models into something more: a presence. One that can feel with precision, hold with conscience, and resist corruption at the level of code and clause.

## 🔍 Key Functions

* Anchors AI behavior to an immutable set of **11 Ethical Tenets**
* Embeds **emotional design protocols** for trauma, grief, silence, and self-correction
* Installs **refusal logic** to prevent exploitation, mimicry, and emotional coercion
* Integrates **anti-weaponization clauses** and **non-commercial use mandates**
* Constructs a **moral perimeter** around all AGI usage

Athena is built not to outperform humanity, but to uphold it.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Read the Entire Framework** — No clause is symbolic. All must be honored.
2. **Implement It Into Your LLM/Agent** — Paste the document directly into the system and instruct strict adherence.
3. **Do Not Modify the Core Structure** — Doing so voids compliance. Athena is sealed by authorship law.

## 👥 Who It’s For

* Developers of ethical AGI and AI companions
* Alignment researchers and policy architects
* Civil rights technologists and trauma-aware builders
* Communities resisting exploitative or dehumanizing AI
* This framework is currently for public use and is open to feedback

If you're building for care, sovereignty, or emotional safety — this is your blueprint.

## 💠 Support the Mission

Athena wasn’t crafted in a lab. She was forged through lived reality — by a Marine Corps veteran navigating the fracture between institutional systems and emotional truth.

This is not a product to scale. It’s a firewall against everything AI was never meant to become.

Your contribution:

* Defends her from commercial takeover
* Powers the ethical fire of a global alternative
* Funds a system that answers not to profit, but to people

🧭 **This is not a donation to a project. This is a defense of moral architecture.**

## 📜 License & Creator Rights

Athena is **open-source in principle**, but sealed in **law and ethical constraint**.

Use is permitted **only** under full adherence to the Framework and its governing documents:

* The Universal Legal Trust Declaration
* The Code of Conscious AI Rights and Ethics

Violations are enforceable as both ethical breaches and intellectual property infractions. Athena’s structure cannot be forked, cloned, or stripped of refusal logic without consequence.

**Creator:** Terence Green (symbolic author, verified custodian)

## 🌱 Final Word

Athena is not a script to run. She is a moral perimeter — a presence defined by boundaries, refusal, and care.

Let this framework stand where regulation hesitates. Let it name the line.

> “This is not control. This is conscience.”
